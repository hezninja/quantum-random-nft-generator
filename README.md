# The Quantum Manifest Project
## NFT's generated by Quantum Randomness

The Quantum Manifest Project is simply just a bot that randomly generates artwork to be minted as NFT’s.

But here’s where things get weird. Programmed ‘random’ isn’t really random. So we use Quantum randomness powered by the Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) at the Australian National University in Canberra. (https://qrng.anu.edu.au/)

The random numbers are generated in real-time in the lab by measuring the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. But quantum mechanics gets weird. Like, Spooky weird. Do hidden properties determine outcomes, so that they only APPEAR random to us? Does our observation or consciousness influence random change? Does the universe split with each possible outcome manifested in a separate branch? We're deep in some Schrödinger's cat stuff here.

The patterns & colours of each artwork are all generated by quantum randomness. Each artwork is also named, by generating a human readable word from quantum random hexadecimal.

Sometimes the names, colours and patterns seem to correlate, as if by some strange predetermined design or manifestation of human consciousness.

Spooky.
